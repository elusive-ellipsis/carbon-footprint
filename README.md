# carbon-footprint
Hi! If you're reading this, it's safe to assume that you found our GitHub page okay.
Along with the code for the website (in the folder footprint), we have added our research data on carbon footprints and the C# code that we initially used to create our quiz.

None of us had a great deal of experience in producing a website, so our development consisted of a lot of trial and error! Still, we enjoyed ourselves and have made something we're proud of. If you want to see the website up and running, have a look here: https://ked4797.github.io/
