# carbon-footprint
Hi! If you're reading this, it's safe to assume that you found our GitHub page okay.
Along with the code for the website (in the folder called footprint), we have added our research data on carbon footprints and the C# code that we initially used to create our quiz.

None of us had much experience developing a website, so it was something of a steep learning curve and a lot of trial and error. Still, we managed to get a 'first draft' of it up and running. If you'd like to see it, go here: https://ked4797.github.io/
